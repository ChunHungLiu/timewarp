You will also find a ready to use set of useful mixins.\r\n\r\n### variables coding convention\r\n**color-** is the prefix for colors variables. \r\n**font-** is the prefix for fonts variables. \r\n**spacing-** is the prefix for spacings variables (margin, paddings).\r\n**width-** is the prefix for width variables. \r\n**height-** is the prefix for height variables. \r\n**lineHeight-** is the prefix for line height variables. \r\n\r\n### resetting styles\r\nTimewarp comes with **normalize** and Meyer's **reset**. Choose you own, including it into **style.scss**.\r\n\r\n### style.scss\r\nNo style in there, just imports. If you want to change something, edit the corresponding **_layout.wathever.scss** file.\r\n\r\n### mobile first\r\nThe css architecture is splitted into common breakpoints to help you in responsive development.\r\nStarting with baseline shared styles (**_layout.common.scss**) and introducing more advanced layout rules when screen size permits keeps code simpler, smaller and more maintainable. That's why you will find files for common breakpoints: **1240up** for large screens, **1030up** for regular desktop screens, **768up** for tablets and small laptops, **481up** for phablets.\r\n\r\n## JS folder\r\n### files naming convention\r\n**app.** is the prefix for your app core files. \r\n**lib.** is the prefix for external libraries and dependencies (ex. angular, jquery, etc). \r\n**plugin.** is the prefix for jquery plugins.\r\n\r\n### javascript included files\r\n**app.controller.js** angularjs app boilerplate. \r\n**app.main.js** should contain jquery and presentational stuff.\r\n**plugin.boilerplate.js** a jquery plugin boilerplate.\r\n**lib.analytics.js** google analytics, just set the GA code.\r\n\r\n## Grunt\r\nTime warp comes with grunt to minify, concat, than uglify your scripts.\r\n\r\n## Compass\r\nTime warp comes with compass to help you styling things faster.\r\n\r\n### [!] NOTE\r\nThis boilerplate is work in progress.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
